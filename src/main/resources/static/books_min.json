In fact, Max can stay awake for about 20 hours every day without feeling tired. But his parents are worried that lack of sleep can influence his health in a bad way. They just want their son to be a normal kid. To their disappointment, the doctor confirms their fears. He says that the condition is serious and the boy can die before he is forty. Max is given a choice: he either takes special drugs to sleep like all the others or he keeps on living the same way at the risk of dying young. The boy decides to enjoy his life as it is and hope for the better. He lives happily until the betrayal of his beloved person changes everything.",

Some of them enjoyed the luxury of the Titanic, others hoped to get to America and start a new life there. But their excitement was not to last long.

When we were studying at school with my friend, there was one boy. He was a sneak. He always told the teachers wrong things other children did. But he didn't see these bad deeds with his own eyes. He just knew everything and the teachers believed him. I don't know what it was. Was it a third eye or a sixth sense? It is unknown. I don't know much about these things.

The most welcome guest was Apollo - god of music and light. He prepared something special for the newborn. Apollo gave Orpheus the most valuable thing he had - his lyre. The god of music also predicted Orpheus' future. Kissing Orpheus' forehead, Apollo filled the baby's body by special power. This power gave the opportunity to combine father's music and mother's poetry. And the lyre would open people's hearts and exalt their souls.

Each victim (as Doe thinks) is the standard of that sin to be punished. The sophisticated tormentor and murderer leaves only a title of the sin and a clever puzzling clue at the crime scene, allowing to find the next 'sinner'.

This sword is a prototype of any magic weapon in the modern literature. The king's mentor, the wise wizard Merlin, also became the basis for hundreds of characters in the years to come. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this text for the world culture. Even Sir John Tolkien took much from the Arthurian legends for his \"Lord of the Rings\". King Arthur is a Celtic hero, but the Knights of the Round Table belong to the German, Welsh, French people.This book is a must-read for classical literature and modern phantasy lovers.",

Those heroic men had a very bad equipment \u2013 only knitted jackets, forged boots and some ice axes. It was only the beginning of the twentieth century. In spite of such unfavorable conditions, they did something no one had ever done before. Nowadays it is quite difficult to imagine how it was possible to get such an achievement one century ago. And how they did their last step into the obscurity. Not many people dare attempt to climb Mount Everest even with the modern equipment. Only few daredevils manage to reach the top. It remains a mystery how these heroes really conquered Everest first. But in this book, you will find much compelling evidence.",

It is one of the first novels written in colloquial English with the usage of jargonisms. This story describes a lot of different small towns and nationalities living near the Mississippi river. The book is full of sarcasm and mockery of many prejudices of that time including racism. Mrs. Douglas adopts Huckleberry Finn. The adoptive mother is desperately trying to educate him and make more religious. The boy is bored and runs with Tom Sawyer to the gang of \"robbers\". Later the father kidnaps Huck. He manages to escape and starts his own raft trip down the Mississippi.",

The main character is one of them. The young student Rodion Raskolnikov commits a crime. He kills an old woman. He does it not because he is poor and cannot pay for his education or flat.

The Prince asks a little Swallow for help. The Swallow faces a difficult choice, as his friends are waiting for him in Egypt. A Giant is the main character of the second story. He is the owner of a beautiful garden. The Giant is very selfish and he does not allow children to play near his house. That is why Spring never comes to his garden. Only one little boy manages to melt the Selfish Giant's heart and return beauty to the garden.",

Aristotle taught him how to demonstrate the force moderately and consciously. Alexander treated his teacher with admiration and respect. He often said that he owed life to his father and a decent life to Aristotle. Achilles \u2013 the hero of the Trojan War was the ideal for Alexander.

Titanic was not destined to return to the port from that voyage and many people died. But during this catastrophe many instances of courage and self-sacrifice were noticed. The night of April 14, 1912 is remembered by the whole world. The crew worked the whole night to save as many passengers as possible. But there were also such passengers who thought only of themselves and did not even try to help others. They pushed the women and children away to take their places in the lifeboats.

One elderly Frenchwoman Madame Giselle is found dead for some time before getting on the plane. The murder is daring as there were 10 passengers, but nobody saw how it happened. The case is shameless because somebody put the direct evidence to none other than Hercule Poirot! He cannot stand such unprecedented impudence. So, we have 12 suspects: a well-known archeologist and his son-archeologist, two stewards, an aristocrat, a countess, a former actress, an assistant of one London hairdresser, a popular dentist, an ENT doctor, a head of one large company, a famous author of detective stories and Hercule Poirot himself. Do you have any ideas, which one of these people is the murderer?",

How do people get their talents? Some think that it is a gift from God. Other think that people are born with it. Somebody says that a talent can be developed due to hard work. Or it is simply a good luck. The Bront\u00eb family got an unordinary talent. They did not have any special education in this area, but still they achieved a huge success. But fate was not benevolent to them. Their lives were short and hard. Poverty made the sisters work since childhood. The diseases took them away one by one. The writers left immortal works. The biography of famous sisters Charlotte, Emily and Ann has a significant mark in the literature.",

The miserable man went to his painter friend... The Irish philosopher, esthete, writer and poet Oscar Wild wrote this masterpiece in 1887. Wilde's name is connected with the rebellion against Victorian morality with its substitution of bad for good and vice versa. His prose intended to offend the socially accepted tastes and conventions.

In their youth, the Beresfords used to rest on the deserved laurels as smart detectives. Now they are tired of inactivity and uselessness. Suddenly Tommy gets a great opportunity to uncover the Nazi agents' atrocities who arranged the murder of Farquhar. Tommy is to take his place in the department. The last words of Farquhar \"N or M. Song Susie\" are all to start with. Everything has to be a secret for Tuppence but she learns about this new case and follows her husband. So, they begin to act together again.",

After all, the list of stolen things looks rather unusual. After a while they find the corpse of one of the inhabitants. It was a murder staged to look like a usual suicide. The case which seemed innocuous, takes a very serious turn. Will the detective be able to save the situation? Will he show his genius once again? The children's verselet, that became the title of the novel, sounds really ominously. The novel's atmosphere perfectly emphasizes this.",

Now he's out of prison, and he wants two things: to know who gave his name to the police eight years ago, and to find his girlfriend.Moose means trouble, and it's the sort of trouble a private detective should stay away from. So of course Philip Marlowe runs straight into it: trouble with the police, trouble with women, trouble with almost every criminal in California. And trouble with murder. Even when he tries to walk away from it, this sort of trouble just follows him around\u2026",

Being the personal chiromancer of Lady Windermere, he reads fortune on the palms of those who wish to learn their future. When Arthur Savile's turn comes, the chiromancer suddenly gets pale and pauses. Gradually he recovers and predicts a journey and death of one of the relatives. Lord Arthur Savile notices the embarrassment of the fortune teller. The lord demands the truth and proposes a considerable reward. The chiromancer tells the lord what he had really seen on his palm.",

Her parents divorced when she was 6 and she survived the Second World War. Ballet was her dream but her appearance wasn't suitable for this kind of art as Audrey had overweight. The years of war and hunger solved this problem. She became very thin and fragile. When she became a bright ballet star, a film director noticed her beauty and grace. Audrey was invited for filming.

The government's duty is to take care of these necessary things. That is how it should be. But our world is not perfect and the inspector who checks schools knows about this. He arrived in this Pakistani village to check out the room and how the classes are being taught. He has to control the conditions and quality of the children's education. The Inspector has been holding this post for three years. He has been constantly travelling around the towns and villages of this region. Everywhere he faces the same problems: lack of books, lazy students, carefree people and teachers who work only for gifts and extra fees. But here he has one more difficult task. He cannot find the only school in this village. The Inspector wanders through the dirty streets and fields. The only local resident who he meets is also unable to help him.",

With the help of clever lawyers he succeeded in it. A few months after he separated from his wife, Skip had a heart attack.
